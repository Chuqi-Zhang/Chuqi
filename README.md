# Introduction

Hi everyone! I am Chuqi Zhang, and I am currently learning programming. I hope to improve my problem-solving skills and provide more possibilities for future career development by learning code.

## My Programming Journey

As a programming beginner, I mainly learn Python because of its concise syntax, easy to get started, and strong community resources.

## Learning Goals

My short-term goal is to master the basics of Python and be able to complete some small projects independently, such as developing a simple web application. In the future, I hope to be proficient in multiple programming languages ​​to help me get more opportunities.

### Currently Learning

- Basic Python Syntax
- Use of Linux

## What I Want to Communicate with You

I think sharing experiences with others and learning from each other is the best way to make progress. Therefore, I hope to be able to exchange ideas, share projects, and help each other with more people with the same interests through this GitHub platform

If you have any suggestions or resources for learning programming, or want to discuss some programming issues together, please feel free to contact me!
